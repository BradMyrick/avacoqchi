# AvaCoqChi

AvaCoqChi is a Tamagotchi-style game built on the Avalanche network, where players raise and care for virtual chickens using the $COQ token. This interactive game is designed to increase the utility and demand for $COQ by integrating it into various in-game activities.

## About The Project

AvaCoqChi is developed as part of the Inaugural COQ INU Hackathon. The game aims to provide a fun and engaging way for $COQ holders to interact with their tokens while also contributing to the COQ INU ecosystem.

### Features

- **Token Utility**: Players use $COQ to purchase in-game items, maintaining an active use case for the token.
- **Token Burn**: A percentage of the $COQ spent in the game is burned, creating a deflationary mechanism for the token.
- **Community Engagement**: The game encourages regular interaction within the community, fostering a stronger and more engaged COQ INU ecosystem.
- **Treasury Building**: A portion of the in-game transactions is allocated to a community treasury for future development and rewards.
- **Brand Awareness**: AvaCoqChi serves as a platform to introduce new users to the COQ INU brand and its values.
